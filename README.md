# BASC0005- Quantitative Methods: Data Science and Visualisation group project

This repository consists of our Jupyter notebooks, on which we have analyzed the questions: 

1) What are the characteristics of London women who have been victims of VAWG (violence against women and girls) offences?
2) What are the variables that have a relationship with VAWG offences across London boroughs?

The nature of this investigation is a group project conducted by four UCL students for the class BASC0005- Quantitative Methods: Data Science and Visualisation.

## Requirements 

To run the code you will need to install:
- jupyter
- plotly

You will also need to download the datasets used in this analysis. Links to these datasets can be found on the website dedicated to our project.

## Improvements

Aside from the inherent limitations from our investigation itself, there are improvements that can be made to the analysis we have conducted. 
Although we managed to make the plots for our visualisation interactive, it would have been interesting to add a slider, which could have allowed for a better 
understanding of how the situation advanced through time. Similarly, it could have been more practical to add an option to select the timespan for which the pie
charts appear, instead of showcasing them all.
